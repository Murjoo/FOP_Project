## Project Overview
This project is a **Golang interpreter implemented in Java**. It parses and executes Go (Golang) code, showcasing functionality like tokenization, parsing, and execution within a Java environment.

---

## File Roles

- **Main.java**  
  Acts as the tokenizer. It processes the input Go code provided by the user and generates tokens for further parsing.

- **Handler.java**  
  Responsible for parsing the tokens generated by `Main.java`. It organizes the data, passes back to Main and goes further for execution.

- **Executor.java**  
  Executes the parsed code and returns the results to the user.

---

## How to Use
1. Compile the project using any Java compiler.
2. Run the `Main.java` file with the input Go code as an argument or through the input prompt (Follow the instructions, if you run it with software).
3. View the results of the interpreted Go code in the console.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary implementation language.
- **Golang (Go)**: Language being interpreted.

## Contributions

- **Giorgi Murjikneli** -- Made variable assignment, block (nested code) extracter, eval method, syntax check.

- **Deme Mikeladze** -- Developed 'for' - 'while' loop interpreter, got information about general golang code, helped with extracting material

- **Luka Meqoshvili** -- Made 'if' interprent, got general knowledge about crafting interprenters and generously sharing with us to give us basic idea how to build it

- **Gigi Mikadze** -- Made executor and arithmetics method
