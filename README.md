## Project Overview
This project is a **Golang interpreter implemented in Java**. It parses and executes Go (Golang) code, showcasing functionality like tokenization, parsing, and execution within a Java environment.

---

## File Roles

- **Main.java**  
  Acts as the tokenizer. It processes the input Go code provided by the user and generates tokens for further parsing.

- **Handler.java**  
  Responsible for parsing the tokens generated by `Main.java`. It organizes the data for execution.

- **Executor.java**  
  Executes the parsed code and returns the results to the user. This file handles the core interpretation and execution logic.

---

## How to Use
1. Compile the project using any Java compiler.
2. Run the `Main.java` file with the input Go code as an argument or through the input prompt.
3. View the results of the interpreted Go code in the console.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary implementation language.
- **Golang (Go)**: Language being interpreted.
